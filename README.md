# GettingandCleaningData
This repository is used for my course project in Getting and Cleaning Data classes.
In this repository, we have three files: 
				run_analysis.R
				README.md
				Codebook.md

Here are the data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

1. Download and unzip it, we will get the Folder name "UCI HAR Dataset"
2. Set "UCI HAR Dataset" as your working directory in R and place the run_analysis.R in this folder.
3. Verify your working directory by getwd() command:
[1] "D:/E-Learning/Coursera/Data Science/Getting and Cleaning Data/Course Project/UCI HAR Dataset"
4. Run the entire run_analysis.R to get the final tidy data set 
5. Detailed explanations are commented within the run_analysis.R
